* done

- basic HM calculus

- vm with function currying 
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/make-fast-curry-pushenter-vs-evalapply/]

- polymorphic variants
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/extensible-records-with-scoped-labels/]
  - needs actual label scoping
  - attribute selection using chinese remainders

* needed

- currying: store argc for builtin functions
- datatypes + pattern matching
 
- runst-like monad escape (almost done)

- mutable refs, records
  
- record selector + separate compilation?
  - find a way to hash symbols with prime numbers globally
  - fix minimum record size

* planned

- typeclasses
  - need higher-order polymorphism for monads
  - maybe [http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/pubs/popl97-fcp.pdf] could work?


* lolwat

- modules
  - at least, some kind of separate compilation strategy w/ parametric polymorphism?

- existentials ? 
  - could row-polymorphism be used instead to package interfaces?

- lifetime inference/ownership tracing
- macros?
